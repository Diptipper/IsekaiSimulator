# Isekai Simulator
This is a compendium dedicated to explaining the tech behind my game.
I'm a physicist so I will focus mostly on the mathematical aspect.
I will probably also write about Godot implementation if I find something interesting.

## What is Isekai Simulator?
Isekai Simulator is a game I am still developing. The end goal is to make an open-world game similar to Skyrim but with all of its elements procedurally generated (procgen).

You see, many procgen games suffer from a common problem: the world is large but shallow. I plan to avoid this curse by making every area, every quest, and worldbuilding interesting. It's very ambitious. Keep reading if you are curious about how I'm doing it.
